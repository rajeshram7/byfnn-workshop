    "```\n",
    "model = Sequential()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "**You can add layers to your model with `model.add(`layer`)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Dense` layers are fully connected, with each neuron in the previous layer being connected to each neuron in the new layer. The number you pass as an argument is the number of new neurons that are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the input layer doesn't actually do anything, the first layer you create with Keras is really the first *hidden* layer. It has to know how many inputs to expect, which you can specify with `input_shape`. After the first layer, no other layer needs `input_shape`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "model.add(Dense(100, input_shape=(784,)))\n",

    "**After adding a `Dense` layer, you can add an `Activation` layer.**\n",

    "This layer represents the activation functions for all the neurons in the layer before it. There are plenty of choices of actiation functions: `'sigmoid'`, `'hard_sigmoid'`, `'relu'`, `'softplus'`, `'tanh'`, `'softsign'`, `'softmax'`, `'elu'`, `'selu'`, and `'linear'`. If you're curious about what these activation functions look like, google is your friend!\n",
