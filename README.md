# Build your first neural network workshop


## Pre-reqs

**Install Python**

If you don't yet have Python on your machine, I recommend installing the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). It comes packed with lots of fun goodies including Jupyter notebook.

If you already have Python but not Anaconda, you'll need to install Jupyter notebook. In your terminal, enter:
```pip install jupyter```

**Clone this project, and install its dependencies**

If you installed Anaconda on Windows, open Anaconda Prompt. For everyone else open your normal terminal.

Navigate to where you want the files to go and enter:
```
git clone https://github.com/tamera-lanham/byfnn-workshop.git
cd byfnn-workshop
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

At the end it should display a URL for you to paste to your browser where you can get to Jupyter notebook.

If you have trouble with any of these steps, it's no big deal. Just come to the workshop with what you have and we'll help you out!
